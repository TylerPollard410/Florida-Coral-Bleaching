# Motivation

Coral bleaching is when corals are stressed by changes in conditions such as temperature, light, or nutrients, leading them to then expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn completely white. There are several factors that contribute to coral bleaching, including but not limited to: rising sea temperatures, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification, all of which are consequences of climate change. This study will utilize data containing covariates such as date year, latitude, longitude, temperature, turbidity, and more. The response variable for this study is the percentage of coral bleaching occurring in transect segments. The dataset contains 2,394 observations from 2006 to 2016 and is sourced from the [Florida Reef Resilience Program](https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/773466). \textbf{The objective of this study is to determine what covariates most heavily impact coral bleaching, and if coral bleaching has progressed over time}.

# Data

The distribution for `PercentBleaching` was skewed right with support [0,1] and a relatively large number of observations (201 out of 2394) of 0 `PercentBleaching` as seen in the figure below. The beta distribution was a natural selection to model the data due to the support. After further examining the 0 values, they were deemed valid and considered as part of the same process that generated the rest of the data. To adhere to the soft (0,1) in beta regression, the 0 values were replaced with 0.001 and the 1 values were replaced by 0.999 as a simple workaround.

# Model Description

The data set included information on 3 types of possible predictors of Percent_Bleaching that we could include in our model:

Sample Site: Distance_to_Shore, Exposure, Turbidity, Cyclone_Frequency
Date Information: Date_Year, Date_Month, Date_Day
Temperature: ClimSST, SSTA, SSTA_DHW, TSA, TSA_DHW

TSA: Thermal Stress Anomaly: Weekly sea surface temperature minus the maximum of weekly climatological sea surface temperature.
TSA_DHW: Thermal Stress Anomaly (TSA), Degree Heating Week (DHW): Sum of previous 12 weeks when TSA >=1 degree C.
SSTA: Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly: Weekly sea surface temperature minus weekly climatological sea surface temperature.


The SSTA SSTA_DHW and TSA TSA_DHW set of predictors were highly correlated with each other. The Gaussian model was initially fit twice with each of these temperature sets and from DIC/WAIC calculations the TSA/TSA_DHW* set was slightly better and the full set of predictors above without SSTA and SSTA_DHW were included in both initial models.

Before the models were fit 25% of the data was randomly selected to be excluded as a test data set and the models were fit on the remaining 75% training data set. Each model was iteratively fit to identify parameters that were deemed insignificant based on their posterior 95% credible interval. The corresponding predictors were removed from the model and the model was fit again until all parameters were significant.

Since the final two candidate models had different likelihoods, posterior predictive checks and mean absolute deviance were used to select the best model.

# Model 1: Multiple Linear Regression

The first model to be fit was a multiple linear regression model chosen to have uninformative Gaussian priors and a normal likelihood with the response

The linear model will take on the form

The following priors were selected: 

The significant variables for this model are Date_Year, Date_Month, Distance_to_Shore, Turbidity, Cyclone_Frequency, Depth_m, TSA, and TSA_DHW.

This model had great convergence and a decent mean absolute deviation of 10.51, but ultimately was not the best for the data at hand due to the presence of negative values in the posterior distribution.

# Model 2: Beta Regression

The second model to be fit was a beta regression model with a likelihood that assumes a beta distribution for the Percent_Bleaching response variable 

The beta regression model takes on the form:

The following priors were selected for the model:

The significant covariates for this model are Distance_to_Shore, Date_Year, TSA and Cyclone_Frequency. 

This model had good coverage with mean absolute deviation of 0.1018. On the right, the posterior predictive checks on the training data closely resemble the observed data.

# Model Results

The beta regression model proved to be a better fitting model than the multiple linear regression model after comparing the Bayesian p-values from the posterior predictive checks for the lower quantile, median, and upper quantile.

The p-values were all 0 and 0.988, 0.201, and 0.122 for the quantile checks for MLR and beta, respectively.

The MLR model had better p-values for mean and standard deviation, but this was disregarded due to the presence of these parameters in the model.

Using the parameters from final beta regression model and the out of sample test data, the posterior predictive distribution was generated from 8000 MCMC simulations. The upper plot on the right shows each of these posterior predictive distribution samples compared to the true distribution of the test data.

The final beta regression model had coverage of 94.1% as seen in the lower plot on the right of the 95\% credible interval for each of the 596 test data points compared to the actual value.

# Conclusions & Further Questions

Conclusions:

Thermal stress anomaly (TSA) and year (Date_Year) were the most significant effects on coral bleaching.

Holding all other predictors constant, increasing thermal stress anomaly, year, or distance to shore resulted in higher percent bleaching.

There is a significant effect of cyclone frequency on percent bleaching which could be due to large storms cooling surface water temperatures.

Further Exploration:

Our posterior appeared to be shifted to the right because the data are zero-inflated, so a hierarchical model could have been another pathway for a Bayesian analysis. 

With more time and computing power, it would be interesting to fit a model for the entire aggregated data set which contains over 40,000 observations from across the globe, however, this would entail much more data cleaning beforehand and the inclusion of spatial effects.
